Hello! This project (Fakeymon) was developed by Paul Karmel in 2018.
This is a Java program developed in an attempt to further my understanding of object-oriented programming & data structures.
I understand that it might be difficult to read the code because of the program's ineffective style. I apologize for this. The program was written during the first year of my software programming career, and I was ignorant about the importance of writing clean code.

All of the sounds, graphics and animations were created from scratch by Paul Karmel.
Please launch the JAR file in order to play the game.

Thank you!
