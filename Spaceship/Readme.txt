Hello! This program (Spaceship) was developed by Paul Karmel in 2018.
This is a Java program developed in an attempt to learn more about the graphics implementations in Java.
I understand that it might be difficult to read the code because of the program's ineffective style. I apologize for this. The program was written in the first year of my software programming career, and I was ignorant about the importance of writing clean code.
This program was developed in two days.

All of the sounds, graphics and animations were created from scratch by Paul Karmel.
Please launch "SpaceMain" in order to play the game.

Press "R" in-game to reset your high-score.
Press "C" in-game to close the program.
Arrow keys are used to move. Hold the spacebar to shoot.

Bullets are buggy.

Thank you!
